      <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
      <p>The opioid epidemic is hurting real people: every 10 minitues, a mother, child, friend, neighbor, or fellow American dies from a drug overdose.</p>
      <p>Today, Donald Trump is finally excepcted to declear the opioid crisis a national emergencyâ€”more than two months after he first committed to the declaration, and potentially more than 10,000 overdoses later. </p>
      <p>But without significant new funds for a long-term, comprehensive strategy for both prevention and treatment, a national emergency alone is not likely to be successful.</p>
